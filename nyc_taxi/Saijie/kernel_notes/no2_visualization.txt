Kernel: Strength of visualization-python visuals tutorial
Author: BuryBuryZymon

Notes:
1. Datasets
	a. NYC taxi train-test (provided)
	b. NYC OSRM dataset (fatest route, and second fatest route and path, trip duration information)
	c. Weather data (precipitation, snowfall) since weather affects traffic, traffic affects travel time

2. About Data
1) log(trip_duration) like Gaussian; most are 1 to 60 mins; mostly in manhattan or in new york only

2) pick and drop location are centered around 40-41 latitude, -74 to -73 longtitude

3) Further narrow the location: 40.6 to 40.9 latitude and -74.05 to -73.70 longitude

4) Vendor 1 and vendor 2 are different (vendor1 has two peaks in Jan and Feb)

5) From heat map (in manhatten most of the trips are getting originated)

6) the difference between average tiume taken by vendor 1 is ~250 seconds more than vendor 2

7) remove zero passenger_count and negative times; vendor one has more number of larger trips than vendor two for passanger count 2 and 3

8) Time taken by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are greater than rest of the days.

9) Clustering (from california, from the sea, from very north) remove wrong data

3. Model
1) XGB model

8) Time taken by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are greater than rest of the days.
